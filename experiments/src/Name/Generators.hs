-- headache tracker
-- quickcheck requires the signal data type to derive (implement) show (aka .toString) and arbitrary
-- show is esentially an interface (typeclass) that defines functions the data type must implement (derive)
-- we must define some equality operator that compares first n elements of a signal using take function

-- we dont want the compiler plugin to type check our code, but our type checked async rattus code depends on non type checked code
-- how do we avoid a cyclic dependency between non-type checked and type checked code

-- we want to talk more about Arbitrary clock generation in general. How to do it? how do we know which clocks we advance on. etc.
-- we have an implementation where we have the singleton clock 0. Although when we advance on other clocks, we still get the signal. how come?

-- custom implementation of typeclass to define how to generate an arbitrary sig a
-- We supply arbitrarySig as the (fixed sized) generator Gen (Sig a). sized :: (Int -> Gen a )-> Gen A

  arbitrary = sized (arbitrarySig [1, 2]) -- Fix me. Should be a generated clockset for each signal instance
